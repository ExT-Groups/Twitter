# Twitter
Version of https://github.com/VctrySam/Twitter that can directly runs without any modifications.

Things that I have changed.
1. Created a whole new react-native project.
2. Change Navigator to  NavigationExperimental as it is moved to react-native-deprecated-custom-components

I see some issues in alignment of the screens but I am pretty sure they must be present in the previous version as well.
So not focusing on fixing them.
